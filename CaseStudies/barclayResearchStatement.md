# Research Statement on Versioning Marianne Moore’s “Poetry”
 
Marianne Moore edited her poetry with severity. The poet’s incessant revision of her verse led not only to the proliferation of multiple versions of the poems but also to the eclipse of earlier incarnations of the poems by final or later versions. The editorial course of Moore’s poetry reveals a shifting approach to poetry and thus reading the multiple versions in tandem casts light onto Moore’s trajectory and recalls the younger Moore’s inclinations. These earlier versions of the poems circulated during the 1910s and 1920s—prime decades of Anglo-American modernism—and are what launched Moore’s career.

The epigraph of Moore’s The Complete Poems (1967), however, declares, “Omissions are not accidents”—a bold yet coy gesture indicative of Moore’s commitment to the editorial decisions of her later years. The collection excludes many early pieces as well as neglects to acknowledge the long lives of pieces, like “Poetry,” that had mutated over time. Beyond providing access to the earlier incarnations of “Poetry,” versioning Moore’s much-revised poem will allow scholars to sustain and study multiple visions of Moore from the young poet publishing for the first time during the zenith of high modernism to the self-censoring editor of her later years. Various identities of the poet as well as versions of modernism emerge through the multiple versions of the poem. As “Poetry” embodies a poet’s rapport with her medium, what do the versions disclose about the poet’s evolving attitudes towards poetry? What is the half-life of modernism in “Poetry”?
 
## Why “Poetry”?
 
Despite Moore’s resolute editorial impulse, the earlier versions of “Poetry” garnered Moore success the realm of modernism alongside fellow American poets such as William Carlos Williams, H.D., Ezra Pound, and T.S. Eliot. Williams selected “Poetry” to head the July 1919 issue of Others—the first presentation of the poem. Subsequently Moore’s first authorized collection of poetry, Observations (1924), won The Dial Award for Literature and included an amended version of “Poetry,” with lines reduced. Finally “Poetry” metamorphoses into a three-line complaint at the end of Moore’s career in The Complete Poems. The trajectory of “Poetry” exemplifies what initially established Moore as a modernist as well as her later critical attitudes towards modernist poetry.
 
Note: Another version of “Poetry” exists in first collection of poetry Poems (1921) edited by H.D. and Bryher. Yet Moore had no hand in the editorial process as they published Poems without her consent or knowledge, thus the editorial decisions shaping the poem. For the purposes of this project I have selected poems Moore edited and approved. Yet the H.D. and Bryher version may serve to further nuance the communal undercurrent of modernist poetry and publishing.
 
## Definition of Version
 
A version functions like node on a graph that contributes to the overall definition of a text. Writers, readers, editors, publishers, critics of a text situate the node in a historical moment at which point it absorbs and expresses cultural and aesthetic values. Versioning entails plotting all the nodes or versions of a text in relation to each other and their histories in order to envision the multi-formed life of a text.
 
## Example
 
Moore dramatically alters “Poetry” over time. The poem commences its life as a bulky five-stanza contemplation of poetry in 1919 that Moore reduces to three lines in 1967. Notably, the poem sheds references to the material world, such as animals, professionals, and objects, and instead, presents a more abstract meditation on the medium. Are these former lines a modernist time capsule? Why does Moore erase this material in 1967? Perhaps the streamlined version of “Poetry” repudiates the earlier Moore’s curatorial meandering and initial brushes with modernism and replaces it with a stricter yet more vague definition of modernist poetry in light of the emergence of postmodernism. 
 
## Proposed Workflow
 
Historical Graph:
 
Identify trajectories of the text and plot these categories over time using TimelineJS. For example: publication history, editorial changes, changes at the level of stanza, changes at the level of line. Also: include a timeline that highlights what in the poem perseveres over time. Supplement history of poem with a history of modernist poetry. Incorporate historical material such as photographs and facsimiles
 
Simultaneous representation of multiple versions:
 
Enter text into GitHub as to emulate text and its alterations and create tree of versions. (Q: How to then visualize this tree. On this I am stuck. Suggestions?)
 
## Anticipated Outcomes
 
I aim to sketch a nuanced and dynamic portrait of Moore and bring to the forefront the history of the younger Moore. Criticism often associates the poet with rigid form and severity, and yet her strictness has created a body of fluctuating texts that engage the history of modernism as it spans the early and mid twentieth century. Beyond acknowledging the fluidity of a text, this versioning project considers how Moore’s poetic trajectory and modernist principles and aesthetics mutate over time. The project may shed light on how writers, editors, publishers and readers constructed and received modernism from the 1910s to the 1960s.

## Preliminary Findings

Structure
39 to 38 to 4 lines
5 to 1 stanzas
linebreaks differ (enjambment mid-sentence and mid-word)

Material

From 1919 to 1924:
"autocrats" to "poets" (line 29 / line 28)
"twinkling" to "twitching" (line 19)

From 1919/24 to 67:

- Loss of lists of things, references to concrete materials 
-- Zoological references
-- Note on poetic praxis: definition of poetry as collage of mixed media (documents, textbooks)
-- People/professionals: baseball fan and statistician
-- “case after case” -- specificity

Result
Final version: terse, more abstract, less identifiable as a Moore poem (evading the characteristics of Moore's poetry such as collage, animal references, interests in low-and-high brow cultures)

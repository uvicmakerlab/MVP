#The Texts to be Versioned
I plan to reveal changes both within and across two versions of a scene entitled "Tempête à Penmarch" ("Storm at Penmarch") in *Jean Santeuil*. The scene, itself is divided by two variant endings which Proust composed, but never chose between. The second edition of the novel represents these two variant fragments as discontinuous (how Proust composed them), whereas the first edition rearranges and removes sections from the fragment in order to insert it into a continuous narrative for the scene. More granular variants between the two editions also reflect, and further elucidate, the editorial principles behind these two representations of Proust's narrative composition.

#Rationale for Selected Texts
This approach currently omits Proust's original manuscript and the third edition (2001), produced under the editorial oversight of Jean-Yves Tadié. The third edition largely reproduces the text of Clarac and Ferré's 1971 edition, with the removal of most of that editions critical apparatus, making it what Fredson Bowers calls a practical edition. Because it does not differ significantly from the second edition, and because its does not reflect an editorial principle that intervienes in the linguistic representation of Proust's modernist writing, the third edition will not be versioned. The manuscript is omitted for reasons of access, since it is currently only available at the local collections of the BNF (La Bibliothèque Nationale de France) in Paris. However, the manuscript's status in relation to the two versioned texts is significant, since textual changes between the manuscript and the printed editions of the book are elided in places where both editions have made the same emendation to Proust's manuscript. The critical apparatus from the second edition may be used to reconstruct this second set of variants. The manuscript may be added as a third version if a copy is obtained.


#Versions
As I conceive of it here, each change in the relationship between the volume and the novel (embodied by the editions and printings which materialize the textual changes that demonstrate that changing conception of the whole) marks a new version. Proustâ€™s original *Du cÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann*, located within a three-volume *Recherche*, is one version; the republication of the novel by *NRF* after the war, now located within an expanded and expanding series of forthcoming volumes, is another version. Versioning, as I seek to deploy it, tracks how changes in the textual components of a scene work as metonyms for evolving instantiations of Proustâ€™s modernist project.

#Workflow
Both editions of the novel have been scanned, OCRed using Adobe Acrobate Pro, and then OCR corrected. The OCR corrected texts are versioned using Juxta commons. The resulting text is then encoded into a TEI filed prepared for display using a jquery plugin developed for Versioning Machine by Daniel Carter. Variants are grouped into four categories: grammatical shift (change in tense, number, etc.), change in punctuation, lexical shift (significant change in meaning), text added or removed, and common emendation from manuscript (indicating a suppresses second set of variants). These categories are highlighted and colored using CSS; further highlighting is used to distinguish the fragment that is relocated in the first edition. Annotations are used to explain sections that have been moved, and may also be used for explaining or translating variants.


#Outcomes
The legend and annotations will provide transparency in my sorting methods and allow other scholars to question my judgement, or to use the variants I've identified to make arguments about the changing political, aesthetic, or sexual content of the passage being visualized.

# Research Statement: 

## Rationale for Selected Author and Selected Text: (250)

Joseph Conrad’s Nostromo is ideally suited to this particular digital approach to genetic criticism because of its evolution from a serial publication in T.P.’s Weekly and later publications as two unique but related novel editions. While Nostromo receives much critical attention, the texts studied are often composites of the 1904 Harper’s edition and the 1918 Dent’s edition rather than the 1904 T.P.’s Weekly serial, or the original novel editions listed above.  However, as the primary genetic critic of Nostromo, Cedric Watts, has shown in his criticism, the significant changes between editions of this text means that one’s understanding of Nostromo depends heavily upon which edition is studied. Because of the substantial and incremental revisions between all three editions, genetic critical approaches to Nostromo can elicit new understandings of the texts as individual and related entities.  

## Texts to be Versioned:
 
* 1904 T.P.'s Weekly serial (Jan-Oct 1904)
* 1904 Harper Brother's volume edition (New York)
* 1918 Dent Edition (1918)

## Rationale for Selected Texts: (100)

While Conrad gave the editors of T.P.’s Weekly full license to edit the work for serial publication (Watts “Phases” 98), he was much more scrupulous about the edits for Harper’s volume edition.  As a result, significant revisions from the serial text exist in the subsequent 1904 Harper’s edition.  These changes include revisions to names, locations, events, and the addition of 10,000 to the end of the Harper’s edition. The period between the publication of the Harper and Dent editions spanned WWI. Versioning the Dent edition with the Harper edition may reveal the ways in which the changing world conditions affected variants between the two or even three witness texts. 

## The Working Definition of a Version in this Instance (no more than three sentences): 

For the purposes of the Nostromo project, a version is different from an edition and a witness. Unlike an edition of the text that accounts for the variants within a single text, e.g. the Gabbler edition of Ulysses, a version for this project makes no claim to be an ur-text or a new iteration of the text. In this instance, a version is the isolation and collation of differences between variant witness texts. 

## One Concrete Example of Why Versioning Will Be Interesting (100): 

Using the second workflow revealed that there was a shift within each text regarding who calls Nostromo what in the text. The Mandala Browser’s collation of the TEI data revealed that Giselle overwhelmingly possesses Nostromo in the novel edition. However, she does not possess him at all in T.P.’s Weekly. In the case of Giselle’s iterative possession of Nostromo, all these instances occur in the romance plot. Scholars such as Jeffers have dismissed Nostromo as of "no real interest" in the romantic plot which was absent from the T.P.'s Weekly edition and added to the end of the Harper edition. However, it is in the romantic plot and through his romantic interest that Nostromo is possessed. 

## A Proposed Workflow: (100)

Two proposed workflows exist for the Nostromo. Both workflows require clean copies of the witness texts. The first workflow proceeds to diff the two witness texts in Juxta which yields a TEI output of the differences between the two witnesses. These differences are then given xml:ids, and the TEI document is then versioned using the Mandala Browser visualization tool. The output for this workflow focuses on the differences between the two texts. 

For the second workflow, the two witnesses are first marked up in TEI using a tagset predetermined by the research questions.  The TEI file for each witness in uploaded to the Mandala Browser to produce visualizations.  The visualizations of each witness text are then compared. The output of this workflow highlights both the relationships within each individual text and the differences between the two texts. 

## Anticipated Outcomes: (100)

The project has already shown that substantial differences exist between the first two editions and that these differences, especially in relation to the different epithets associated with the character Nostromo, have significant meaning, affecting the way the texts engage with issues of economy, race, and even gender. By adding the Dent edition as a third witness text, the project will hopefully be able to consider the ways in which the changes brought on by WWI influence this final author-edited edition of the text. 

## Preliminary Findings: 

* Epithets used to refer to Nostromo do change throughout the two editions
* These changes, in part a result of the addition of the "romance plot" in part three of the Harper's edition, point to a Nostromo who is increasingly possessed and in a slave-like relationship with wealth, vanity, and women (notably Giselle who assumes possession of Nostromo as Mitchell's iterative possession of "his man" disolves)
* Female and indigenous characters are seen in groups of people (e.g., villagers, Indios, Indians) more frequently than they are as individuals
* Using the latter workflow might require different iterations of the diff markups (e.g., I might want to have one iteration of the diff markup from the Juxta output that locates epithets as types of difference and attributes a given value to these differences and another markup of the same output that does not mark up epithet changes but that marks up general omissions and aditions related to Nostromo and places a value on these differences instead. This might allow for greater clarity on the visualization level especially if numerical values mean different things for different types of difference).
